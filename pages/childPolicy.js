                  To avoid accidents, chaperones and children will be advised of
                  “house rules” regarding health and safety and will be notified
                  of areas that are out of bounds. Children will be advised of
                  the clothing and footwear appropriate to the work that will be
                  undertaken.

                  If a child is injured while in the care of the society, a
                  designated first-aider will administer first aid and the
                  injury will be recorded in the society’s accident book. This
                  record will be countersigned by the person with responsibility

                  If a child joins the production with an obvious physical
                  injury a record of this will be made in the accident book.
                  This record will be countersigned by the person with
                  responsibility for child protection. This record can be useful
                  if a formal allegation is made later and will also be a record
                  that the child did not sustain the injury while participating
                  in the production.

                  Chaperones will be appointed by the society for the care of
                  children during the production process. By law the chaperone
                  is acting in loco parentis and should exercise the care which
                  a good parent might be reasonably expected to give to a child.
                  The maximum number of children in the chaperone’s care shall
                  not exceed 12.

                <li>
                  Potential chaperones will be required to be Licensed by
                  Cornwall Council and will be need to supply photographic proof
                  of identity (eg. passport, driving licence) and two references
                  from individuals with knowledge of their previous work with
                  children.{" "}

                  Chaperones will be made aware of the society’s Child

                </li>
                <li>
                  Chaperones will not usually have unsupervised access to
                  children in their care. If unsupervised access is unavoidable,
                  or if this is a requirement of the local authority, a DBS
                  check will be sought.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where chaperones are not satisfied with the conditions for the
                  children, they should bring this to the attention of the
                  Director or Chairman. If changes cannot be made
                  satisfactorily, the chaperone should consider not allowing the
                  child to continue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a chaperone considers that a child is unwell or too tired
                  to continue, the chaperone must inform the Director and not
                  allow the child to continue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Under the Dangerous Performances Act, no child of compulsory
                  school age is permitted to do anything which may endanger life
                  or limb. This could include working on wires or heavy lifting.
                  Chaperones should tell the Director to cease using children in
                  this way and should contact the local authority.

                  During performances, chaperones will be responsible for
                  meeting children at the stage door and signing them into the
                  building.

                  When appropriate children will be kept together at all times
                  but this will depend upon the structure of the rehearsal
                  and/or performances and except when using separate dressing
                  rooms.

                <li>
                  Chaperones will be aware of where the children are at all

                  Children are not to leave the theatre unsupervised by

                  Children will be adequately supervised while going to and from

                <li>
                  Chaperones should be aware of the safety arrangements and
                  first aid procedures in the venue, and will ensure that
                  children in their care do not place themselves and others in
                  danger.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Chaperones should ensure that any accidents are reported to
                  and recorded by the society.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Chaperones should examine accident books each day. If an
                  accident has occurred, the producer is not allowed to use that
                  child until a medically qualified opinion has been obtained
                  (not just the word of the parent or child).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Chaperones should have written arrangements for children after
                  performances. If someone different is to collect the child, a
                  telephone call should be made to the parent to confirm the
                  arrangements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Children should be signed out when leaving and a record made

                </li>
                <li>
                  If a parent has not collected the child, it is the duty of the
                  chaperone to stay with that child or make arrangements to take
                  them home.
