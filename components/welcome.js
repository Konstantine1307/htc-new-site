            I first became involved in non-professional theatre in Helston in
            1977 when I joined Meneage Arts Players for their pantomime Mother
            Goose. That was the start of a lifelong passion for the theatre and
            I am very proud to be the current Chairman of Helston Theatre
            Company which was born from the coming together of Meneage Arts
            Players and Helston Musical Theatre Company in 2010.

            on presenting the very best theatre and it is great to see us
